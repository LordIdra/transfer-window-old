# Things to do
[x] Figure out how to get double precision in shaders without completely destroying performance
[x] Move camera freely while locked onto an object (remain in inertial frame)
[x] Keys to speed up / slow down simulation
[ ] Select different objects by double clicking near them w/ prioritisation algorithm
[ ] Key press recenters camera to selected object
[ ] Icons to represent planets/stars/spacecraft when zoomed out
[ ] Smooth transition between objects when selecting them
[ ] API to add and execute burns using simple integrator
[ ] Function to recalculate trajectory so we can redraw vessel trajectory as burn is created
[ ] Upgrade integrator to RK4
[ ] Hide orbits of selected object when zoomed in far enough
[ ] Highlight point on orbit when hovering near it
[ ] Clicking when a point is highlighted brings up a menu
[ ] Add button to menu to warp to that point
[ ] Add button that creates a new burn at that point
[ ] Figure out how to orbit direction symbols for adjusting burn
[ ] Draw symbols prograde, retrograde, radial in and radial out
[ ] Figure out how to detect if user is clicking a symbol
[ ] When symbol clicked, adjust parameters of the burn
[ ] Figure out why there are jumps happening between conic sections???
